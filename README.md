Please type or copy the CS 310 honesty statement here: I have worked on this project individually, and have not given or received too much help. In particular, I have not gained access to any other students' repositories, files, or code, nor have I given any other students access to mine. I have not used generative AI, including but not limited to chatGPT, unless explicitly authorized for this assignment. I understand that my code will be run through a very effective similarity checker, and that academic honesty violations are taken seriously.

With respect to the honesty statement, if you have any doubts whatsoever 
about whether you have completed the assignment appropriately, 
please describe briefly here:

assignment was done with assistance from google and "googling" certain topics and how-to's to learn more about what i need to do for this assignment. However, Google, as of recently, incorporates their own AI. While I have taken suggestions and help from said AI and google search results in relation to my search query, no code that I am submitting was generated by AI, all code in the repository was written by me and only me. I am not sure if that is in violation of the honesty statement above, but please do let me know, as I don't want to be penalized in future assignments. Thanks.
